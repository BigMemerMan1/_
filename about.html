    <p style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font size="+3">I'm a highschool student who enjoys toying around with computers as stated on the first page. I do pixel art, I do art, I code in Python, Unity C#, Unity 4 JavaScript,
        Unreal Engine 4/5 Blueprints and of course HTML. I'm currently learning to build my own pc, not really because I want a better one but i just want the experience
        of making a pc since I think it would be good knowledge to have in future. I also enjoy playing games although I'm not very good at them.<font></p>
