<h2 style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font size=10>Game Development:</font></h2>
<p style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font size=5>All the way back in 2019 i decided to learn game development simply because I was bored and I was really interested in computers at the time and still am.</font></p>
<p style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font size=5>At the time the only game development experience that I had was developing games in block code programs, such as scratch.</font></p>
<h1>-----------------------------------</h1>
<h1 style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font size=10>Game Development: Cubey</font></h1>
<h1>-----------------------------------</h1>
<p style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font size=5>Cubey was my first game that I developed in around 3 days. At the time I had played around with the idea of making a game in 2D
 in the same game engine but i never really got anywhere with it. I decided to pick the Unity game engine as my way of developing the game as it uses real code in the C# coding language and it's beginner friendly for someone like me.
a few images of that same game. Cubey.</font></p>

<h1 style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font size=10>Extra information about Cubey</font></h1>
<h1>-----------------------------------</h1>
<p style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font size=5>Cubey originally started as a 2D platformer but I scrapped the idea since I thought it would be too hard at the time.</font></p>
<p style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font size=5>Cubey was planned to have over 20 levels but i scrapped the idea as I thought I would get burned out too quickly</font></p>
<p style="font-family: 'Arial';"><font size=5>I made Cubey in an earlier version of the Unity game engine just because I thought it looked nice only to realise it doesnt have as many features as the later versions.</font></p>
